## Introduction

This is a complete menu manager for a coffee shop and a restaurant. It is also a menu viewer for all the costumers. 

This application is made for speeding up the process of choosing, ordering and paying for foods or drinks, when you are in a coffee shop or a restaurant.

## Features

Having MyTable, you can handle all the internals of your activity. The main aspects where MyTable will help you a lot are:

* Personalized QR code for online access
* Handle all your menu items
  * Creation and management of different categories
  * Creation and management of all your products and foods
* Handle the orders made from the table
  * Orders handled by your own weiters
  * Orders handled by clients from the table

### Menu 

If you decide to use MyTable in your restaurant, you will have an online private page, where you will have displaied all the items in your own menu, divided in their own categories. 

In this page, you will be able to Create, Update and Delete these items and categories as much as you want, so all your costumers can see your menu change real time. 

Do you want to remove an item because you don't have enough ingredients? You only need a few clicks. Do you want to add a new pizza to your menu? You don't need to create a new paper-made menu and pay for it. Only 5 seconds on MyTable page, and you will be done. 

Simplicity, beautiful user interface, video lessons and article to support you if you need help, you are not alone. 

### Order

Another key feature of MyTable is the order stream. This is pretty simple. You can decide whether orders can be made only from your waiters or also from the table, directly from your users. 

This system avoids most of the errors that sometimes humans made while reporting orders, or while people in the kitchen prepares them. With MyTable, you will have a reliable record to keep track of ordered items and everything that has been asked, and you will decrease the errors you make almost entirely.
